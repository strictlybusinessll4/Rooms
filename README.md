a rooms program that we had to apply one of the designs patterns for

Create a number of rooms that are randomly generated light or dark
allow the user to input name and description of each
and allow the user to traverse through each room starting SOUTH

     []
     |
     |
     \/	     East
    [starts] --> [could branch here]
    			| SOUTH
			|
		       \ /
		       [could then branch her]

I couldn't figure out the random node generation but
we implemented a decorator design pattern to enable detail printing
when its dark or light

anyway if we continue this using decoraters it will take work
